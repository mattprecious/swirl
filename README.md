Swirl
======

Android's animated fingerprint icon provided in a simple, standalone library.

Usage
-----

Since Swirl uses animated vector drawables, default colors cannot be provided and must be specified
in your theme.

```xml
<style name="Theme.YourApp" parent="@android:style/Theme.Material.Light">
  <item name="swirl_ridgeColor">?android:attr/textColorSecondary</item>
  <item name="swirl_errorColor">?android:attr/colorAccent</item>
</style>
```

Then, you may include `SwirlView` anywhere in your app.

```xml
<com.mattprecious.swirl.SwirlView
    android:layout_width="60dp"
    android:layout_height="60dp"
    />
```

Note that this example specifies a width and height and does not use `wrap_content`. Since the
drawables are vectors, there isn't an appropriate size to default to so you must specify one.

Switch between icons by calling `setState()` or by using the `tools:swirl_state` attribute.

See the provided sample for a complete implementation.
